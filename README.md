# Crop Disease Identification

This project is a web-based application for detecting crop diseases using a deep learning model. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of crop leaves and provide information on the detected diseases.

## Project Overview

The application is built using Flask for the web framework and TensorFlow/Keras for the deep learning model. Users can upload images of crop leaves, which are then processed and analyzed to identify potential diseases.

## Features

- Upload images of crop leaves through a web interface.
- Automatically classify the images using a trained deep learning model.
- Display the results with relevant disease information.
- Provide feedback on the health of the plant.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning library used to build and train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- **Python**: Programming language used for backend logic and model training.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend technologies for building the user interface.
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
